Word frequency counter. Designed for Office 2010. The source for this project was created in Visual Studio 2010, but it should compile in Visual Studio 2007 as well.

Documentation is contained within the project. The following points summarise its structure:
- The Ribbon class is the entry point into the add-in. This class calls the Worker Manager class which creates the task pane and asynchronously starts the computation running.
- The frequency calculator (executing asynchronously) continually updates the progress bar in the task pane and places the result of the frequency count in the ResultContainer class.
- IgnoreList is used to find, load and save the ignore list. It also contains a default ignore list.
